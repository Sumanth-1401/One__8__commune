                                The transport vehicles of Telangana Tourism offer a stress-free travel experience to all the visitors. Our drivers are well
                                trained to handle heavy vehicle flow and risky ghat roads. They are well experienced to handle the trickiest of roads as they
                                undergo periodic training where they are specially instructed about road safety, ensuring maximum comfort for the tourists,
                                who are the much-respected guests for the state.

                                for the driver. Keeping this in mind, we appoint two drivers for every 350 kilometers. Due to the highest priority given
                                by the Tourism department for its safe driving practices, our drivers tend to be even more careful to keep up with the reputation.</em>
